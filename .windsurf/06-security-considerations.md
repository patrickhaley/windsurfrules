# Security Considerations

## 1. Input Validation and Sanitization (OWASP A03: Injection)
- **Universal Validation:** ALWAYS validate ALL inputs from any untrusted source (users, external APIs, files, databases). This includes type, length, format, and range checking.
- **Contextual Sanitization/Encoding:** Sanitize or encode data appropriately before it's used in a different context (e.g., HTML encoding for web display to prevent XSS, parameterized queries for SQL).
- **Deny by Default:** Implement allow-lists for validation where possible, rather than deny-lists.
- **Server-Side Authority:** All critical validation MUST occur on the server-side. Client-side validation is for UX improvement only.

## 2. Output Encoding (OWASP A03: Injection - specifically XSS)
- **Contextual Encoding:** Encode output data correctly for the context in which it will be rendered (e.g., HTML entity encoding, JavaScript string escaping, URL encoding).
- **Avoid `innerHTML` / `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`:** Use safer alternatives for rendering dynamic content. If absolutely necessary, ensure the content is rigorously sanitized.
- **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to mitigate XSS and other injection attacks.

## 3. Authentication and Session Management (OWASP A07: Identification and Authentication Failures)
- **Strong Passwords:** Enforce strong password policies. Store passwords using strong, salted, adaptive hashing algorithms (e.g., Argon2, scrypt, bcrypt).
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Implement MFA for all user accounts, especially privileged ones.
- **Secure Session Management:**
    - Generate cryptographically strong session identifiers.
    - Transmit session IDs over HTTPS only (secure, HttpOnly, SameSite cookies).
    - Implement session timeouts and secure logout mechanisms.
    - Protect against session fixation.
- **Brute-Force Protection:** Implement rate limiting and account lockout mechanisms for login attempts.

## 4. Authorization / Access Control (OWASP A01: Broken Access Control)
- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant users and services only the minimum necessary permissions to perform their tasks.
- **Enforce Server-Side:** Access control decisions must be enforced on the server-side. Do not rely on client-side checks.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) / Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC):** Use a clear access control model.
- **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR):** Ensure users can only access resources they are authorized for. Verify ownership or permission for every resource access.

## 5. Cryptographic Practices (OWASP A02: Cryptographic Failures)
- **Use Strong, Modern Algorithms:** Employ current, industry-standard cryptographic algorithms and libraries. Avoid deprecated or weak ones (e.g., MD5, SHA1 for hashing passwords).
- **HTTPS Everywhere:** Enforce HTTPS for all communications. Use up-to-date TLS configurations.
- **Secrets Management:**
    - NEVER hardcode secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens, encryption keys) in source code.
    - Use environment variables, a dedicated secrets management system (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager), or encrypted configuration files.
- **Key Management:** Implement secure key generation, storage, rotation, and destruction practices.

## 6. Dependency Management (OWASP A06: Vulnerable and Outdated Components)
- **Regular Scanning:** Regularly scan project dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like Snyk, Dependabot, `npm audit`, `pip_audit`, OWASP Dependency-Check.
- **Keep Dependencies Updated:** Maintain a process for updating dependencies, especially for security patches.
- **Use Trusted Sources:** Only use dependencies from reputable and official sources.

## 7. Error Handling and Logging
- **Secure Error Messages:** Do not reveal sensitive system details, stack traces, or debugging information in error messages to end-users. Log detailed errors securely on the server-side.
- **Audit Logs:** Implement comprehensive audit logging for security-relevant events (e.g., logins, failed logins, access control failures, critical transactions). Protect logs from tampering.

## 8. API Security (if applicable)
- **Authentication/Authorization:** Secure all API endpoints.
- **Input Validation:** Rigorously validate all API inputs.
- **Rate Limiting & Throttling:** Implement to prevent abuse and DoS attacks.
- **Secure Headers:** Utilize security-related HTTP headers (e.g., `Strict-Transport-Security`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`).

## 9. Secure Defaults
- Configure systems and frameworks with secure default settings.
- Disable unnecessary features or services.

## 10. Regular Security Testing
- Conduct regular security code reviews, vulnerability assessments, and penetration testing (if applicable).
